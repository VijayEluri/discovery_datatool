The Discovery Data Tool provides a cross-platform implementation of a Changeset
Publisher. It uses JDBC to connect to the database and is thus compatible
with most major databases.

Documentation can be found at: http://docs.discoverysearchengine.com/data_integration/datatool.html

Releases can be downloaded from: https://github.com/t11e/discovery_datatool/releases

To run, you will need to create a `discovery_datatool.xml` configuration file and then execute the `run.sh` script. The `examples/` directory contains some example configuration files to
help you get started.
